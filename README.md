# ICS4U-Unit-4-Project
## Project introduction / overview
My game features "Cloudy with a chance of meatballs"'s main character, Flint Lockwood in his attempts to gain points by catching the yummy meatballs and avoid losing points by not colliding with the rotten meatballs!

## What the project does
My project has 3 subclasses of gameObjects which all share the same features such as sizing, positioning, and collison. The 3 objects are Flint(character), good meatballs, and bad meatballs. Game panel draws the background, scoreboard, the character, the objects, creates the timer, and manages user key input. UserInfo deals with the login/registering information such as username, passwords, games played, and highscore based on your account which is saved to the files. The player file makes the constructor for the player and manages its movements and position. MainGame manages the components of the game like having the objects go down the screen and deciding what happens to them upon collision, as well as the players elements within the game. The main file utilizes Jframe, Jpanel, labels, textboxes, etc to create the different screens and utilizes logic like going between screens based on certain expectations.

## How to run the program
The program is run when the "main.java" is the main file and the images I used are saved as files within the project.

## Project goals or purpose
The purpose of this project is to start off with AI starter base code and add your own features to it and enhance it demonstrating skills and concepts learned in ICS4U.

## Installation or setup instructions
Make sure to create a username and password which is used for registeration and saved in a file, and using those same values to return to the game later on.
